[X] Action Plan: Full of Hot Air

Overview
===

**Goal**

1. Finish up loose ends from chapter 100.
2. Address team issues as necessary.
3. Finish up sealing projects.

**Motivations**

**Assumptions**

* We have about three or four weeks left before the next mission.

Methods
===
**Non-scene**: Personal Development Plan
* Execute the winning personal development plan, if there are more than one plans.

**Scene One**: Project [S]Skyhopper[/S] Skywalker

* Goal: Finish developing the skywalker tech.
* Steps:
    * Develop air dome seals that are [less thicker or smaller](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7781535/).
    * Develop air dome seals that can be activated/deactivated by chakra adhesion.
    * If applicable, implement design change to make the Skywalker Seals more resilient to failure mode.
    * Develop safety protocol for using the skywalker.
* Supporting Information:
    * Kagome and Hazou will brainstorm ways that the skywalker seal can main and kill users.
    * Clones will be used for testing.
    * Damage models.
      * It would be great to know the severity of biological damage when the skywalker seals go wrong.
      * Captured animals would be ideal, if gruesome.
      * Watermelons or some other fruits could be used, but much less accurate.
    * Some Test Failure Cases
      * Falling at a fatal velocity before activation.
      * One of both seals ceased to function in midair(duration testing)
      * Using the skywalkers in bad weather.
      * Seals may be damaged during movement (e.g., through movement or substances in the atmosphere).
    * Safety Engineering Ideas:
      * Protective covering for the seals.
      * Extra Air Dome seals.
    * Safety Protocol Ideas:
      * How long you can switch on/off
      * How long you can walk or run.
      * How many seconds you can fall without dying.
      * How to use it safety.
      * How not to use it.
* Potential Issues:
    * The team might not like the idea of doing animal testing
      * If that's the case. Just drop it.
    * Might take too long before the next mission/Keiko's birthday.
      * Make sure that the most obvious and most dangerous test cases are resolved or accounted for.

**Scene Two**: Project Zeppelin

  * Goal: We want an easy, reliable, stealthy, and safe method of long distance travel.   
  * Steps:
    * Bring up the idea with the team, including why it's useful
    * Outline potential seals that could help out with the project.
    * If team approves, start working on the project.  
  * Supporting Information:
    * [Zeppelins](http://markedfordeath.wikia.com/wiki/Zeppelin)
    * Remind the team of festival lanterns that floated into the air.
    * Tell team anecdotes and inspirations, such as the jump.
    * Reasons why it is a good idea.
      * Make border crossing easier.
      * Can be used for long distance travel.
      * Open up trade for the merchant network and the elemental nations.
  * Potential Issues:
    * See the wiki article on the Zeppelin.
    * The team might be dismissive or look at Hazou as if he's crazy.
      
    
**Scene Three: Keiko's Gift**

* Goal: We want Keiko to have a happy birthday.
* Steps:
    * Ask Inoue-sensei for help getting Pandaa on board (she's the only one stealthy enough to talk to him without Keiko noticing).
    * Consider developing things for her:
      
      * Pangolin carving.
    * Get the team in on the plan.
* Supporting Information:
   * Have the team/Kagome pick and choose projects
      * Ideally, it should be the 
   * Seal ideas:
      * Bazooka: Longe range AoE weapon
         * Use a modified version of the unidirectional explosive seal to propel projectiles.
         * Barrel might not withstand object. Could be reinforced temporarily with 5SB.
      * Advanced PMYF Macerators with payloads (for smokebombs, flashbangs, pepper spray).
        * Note: We have to research making the Macerator seals with PMYF function.
* Potential Issues
    * We might fuck things up. We probably will, somehow.
      * Talk to Inoue-sensei about Keiko's birthday first. Tell her our plan, make sure she agrees it won't fuck shit up.
    * We might get called in for a mission.
      * Make sure her birthday gifts are easy to give and won't be spoiled on the way.


**Scene Four: Noburi and Medic Training:**

* Goal: We want to help Noburi finish his medical training safely.
* Steps:
    * Let Noburi know we are supportive of his ambitions as a medic-nin and that we want to help him on that path
    * Discuss potential issues, and how we might address them
    * Do NOT suggest Noburi should not go. Suggest that we should be extra cautious.
* Supporting Information:
* Potential Issues
    * Hashimoto might not want to teach Noburi
      * Ask Noburi what things Hashimoto might want (ryo, Macerators...) and offer to help with getting these things.
    * Hunter-nin might notice Noburi and/or his barrel.
      * Bring up Noburi disguising his barrel as a travel sack or appropriate covering.
      * Suggest Noburi obfuscate his movement through clever Henge use:
        * Noburi + Inoue go to Hashimoto's.
          * When Noburi leaves, Inoue creates a Water Clone Henge'd as Noburi.
          * Inoue & clone leave.
          * Repeat when Noburi leaves (at a set time?).


Contingencies
===


* We should already be ready to relocate at any time. 
  * We should know where we are going to escape.
  * We should have enough seal blanks for escape + mission.
* Interruption By Jiraiya
* Interruption By Pangolins
* Interruption By Hunter-nins
