**Scene Inoue-sensei**

* Steps:
  * Explain to her that it isn't her fault.
  * Analyze the "Join Konoha" question.
  * Make a reply. No to Fire or Leaf citizenship. But willing to consider other angle.
* Supporting Information:
  * We want to consider the political question from all angle.
  * State that the pro are pretty good.
  * Explain possible reasons why it might not be good.
    * Kagome will be anxious about returning to Konoha so soon.
    * Mist will erupt into a frothing rage and declare war if and when they find out.
      * OOC: Given the war that may or may not come soon, this may be a non-issue.
    * We absolutely establish ourselves as an innovative, if not powerful, sealmaster.
      * Leaf will take our threats very seriously, if they weren't before. A Freudian slip kills us horribly.
    * Leaf may choose to take Skywalker seals and kill us to keep us from falling into enemy hands/betraying Konoha.
      * Staying in Konoha mitigates this somewhat.
      * The anti-us faction (who Jiraiya was pushing against) may try to assassinate us for this reason.
    * Leaf becomes absurdly more powerful because they gain (near-)undisputed aerial control.
      * Will making Leaf absurdly powerful help Hazou's dream?
    * Mori and Wakahisa clans will hate Keiko and Noburi.
      * Both of them really do care about their clans. Unlike us; we just care about mummy.
      * We have to run this with them anyway; if they don't accept we aren't doing it anyway.
* Possible Issues:
