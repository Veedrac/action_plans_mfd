  * Respond to the "Join Konoha" question.
  * Make a good present for Keiko.

Methods:
===

### **Scene Inoue-sensei**

* Goal: Finish the conversation with Inoue-sensei.
* Steps:
  * Explain to her that it isn't her fault.
  * Analyze the "Join Konoha" question.
  * Make a reply: Will not commit to anything yet. Need more time.
* Supporting Information:
  * Consider the political question from all angle.
  * State that the pro are pretty good.
  * Possible reasons why it isn't her fault:
    * Hazo's actions aren't her fault.
    * Without Mari's teachings and leadership, the entire team would have died horribly months ago.
      * Nobody on the team died.
      * Hazo's taijutsu style is based significantly off Mari's teaching and examples.
      * Mari held the team together despite issues and troubles.
    * Even if Leaf worked out, the team still need Mari.
      * Emphasis famial or famial-relations, along with Mari-sensei's leadership and teacher status.
      * She is needed to navigate the Leaf political landscape.
   
  * Explain possible reasons why it might not be good.
    * Kagome will be anxious about returning to Konoha so soon.
    * Yagura will get mad
      * Mist will go to war with Leaf, which we do not want.
      * OOC: Given the war that may or may not come soon, this may be a non-issue.
    * Kagome and Hazo are innovative, if not dangerous, sealmasters.
      * Leaf will take our threats very seriously, if they weren't before. A Freudian slip will likely kill us horribly.
      * Hazo has zero political skills and little social grace.
    * Leaf may choose to take Skywalker seals and kill us to keep us from falling into enemy hands/betraying Konoha.
      * Staying in Konoha mitigates this somewhat.
      * The anti-us faction (who Jiraiya was pushing against) may try to assassinate us for this reason.
    * Leaf becomes absurdly more powerful because they gain (near-)undisputed aerial control.
      * Will making Leaf absurdly powerful help Hazou's dream?
      * Won't prevent WW4 from breaking out.
      * Won't guarantee a merciful Leaf.
    * Leaf might not actually be all nice.
      * Example: That Hyuga brat from team Gai
      * Leaf showed us only what they want us to see.
      * Leaf might have a dark underbelly that we did not get to see.
    * Unexplored Options:
      * Hidden Mountain: Keiko might has a way in as the Pangolin summoner.
      * Bargaining for something else other than citizenship.
      * Leave the EN altogether.
      * Establishing Hidden Heaven
    * Mori and Wakahisa clans will hate Keiko and Noburi.
      * Both of them really do care about their clans. Unlike us; we just care about mummy.
      * We have to run this with them anyway; if they don't accept we aren't doing it anyway.
* Possible Issues:
 * Inoue-sensei might get puzzled about the political analysis.
 * Inoue-sensei might decide to kill us depending on our answer.
   * Unlikely. Also, extremely silly.

### Scene Noburi

* Goal: We want to help Noburi finish his medical training safely.
* Steps:
    * Let Noburi know that Hazo is supportive of his ambitions as a medic-nin and that we want to help him on that path
    * Discuss potential issues, and how we might address them
    * Do NOT suggest Noburi should not go. Suggest that we should be extra cautious.
* Supporting Information:
* Potential Issues
    * Hashimoto might not want to teach Noburi
      * Ask Noburi what things Hashimoto might want (ryo, Macerators...) and offer to help with getting these things.
    * Hashimoto might reject Noburi completely no matter the rewards.
      * Ask for referal to another medic-nin that the team could learn from.
    * Hunter-nin might notice Noburi and/or his barrel.
      * Bring up Noburi disguising his barrel as a travel sack or appropriate covering.
      * Suggest Noburi obfuscate his movement through clever Henge use:
        * Noburi + Inoue go to Hashimoto's.
          * When Noburi leaves, Inoue creates a Water Clone Henge'd as Noburi.
          * Inoue & clone leave.
          * Repeat when Noburi leaves (at a set time?).


### Scene Gift for Keiko

* Goal: give Something on Keiko's Birthday that she will like.
* Steps:
  * Brainstorm gift idea with the team.
  * Build it.
  * Gift it.
* Suppporting Information:
  * Gift Ideas:
    * Make a drawing of badass things Keiko's done since we've first mets:
      * Cleanly decapitating the steelback back in Swampland.
      * Retrieving the Pangolin summoning scroll and becoming the Pangolin summoner.
      * Terrifying the shit out of the Irie and Hinago patrols.
      * Skewering Arikada's bodyguards without using chakra.
      * Beating us all in that game of EN!Risk (include Team Keiten).
      * An image of us all (Akane included) with her in the middle (this should be in the center).
    * Combine seal fragments/pieces into the drawing.
      * Don't use chakra ink. Duh.
      * From close up the drawing should be a bunch of seals worked together; when viewed from farther away the seal cluster transforms into depictions of Keiko.
      * If possible, design the drawing such that viewing it from different angles gives a different image (so viewing from below gives Keiko and the steelbacks; viewing from above gives her fighting Arikada's bodyguards), with the other images as background "seals".
* Potential Issues:
  * Kagome-sensei might panic/blow up Hazo at the idea of using sealing fragments
  * Keiko might be depressed by gift showing her in less than favorable light.
    * Use CCnJ to show why this is not the case.

### Scene: Sealing Projects

* Goal: Do more sealing research
* Steps:
    * Finish the Skywalker project if it isn't already. (including safety protocol, safety engineering, safety testing, etc)
    * Choose the next sealing project and work on that.
* Supporting Information:
   * Have the team/Kagome pick and choose projects
      * Ideally, it should have the maxmium reward while still fast enough to develop before the next mission.
      * It should be within Hazo's skill level.
   * Seal ideas:
      * Bazooka: Longe range AoE weapon
         * Use a modified version of the unidirectional explosive seal to propel projectiles.
         * If flexible material available, 5SB variant is feasible:
            * This is to protect the barrel during firing.
            * A separate flat platform from bazooka itself to allow quick sealing before shooting,
            * Hang flexible frame inside rigid exoskeleton, with an excess square off bottom with the 5SB preplaced
            * Need not be particularly gun-shaped or bazooka shape.
      * Gun: Smaller cousin, less collateral damage
         * See the Bazooka for detail
      * Advanced PMYF Macerators with payloads (for smokebombs, flashbangs, pepper spray).
        * Note: We have to research making the Macerator seals with PMYF function.
      * [Poor Man's Shadow Clone Shuriken](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/page-1563#post-7745502)
      * The [Zeppelin Project](http://markedfordeath.wikia.com/wiki/Zeppelin).
        * Do small scale prototype. Focus on hot air balloons.
        * Make wind tunnels for testing and experimental control.
        * Explain using ancedotes and examples such as the jump and sky lanterns.
 * Potential Issues:
 
      
Contingencies
===

* We should already be ready to relocate at any time. 
  * We should know where we are going to escape.
  * We should have enough seal blanks for escape + mission.
* Escape paths:
   * Have traps set up so we can escape to the southwest river or the eastern coast (depending on the situation).
   * More if Kagome-/Inoue-sensei say so.
* Jiraiya calls us in:
   * Figure out what country we're going to, then draft plans
   * Will probably involve water/coastal routes
   * Should be a good stopping point to end an update.
* Pangolin stuff:
   * Be polite and careful. Let Inoue-sensei or Keiko take the leads.
   * Get ready for a mission. See the Jiraiya section.
*  A wild ??? appears:
   * End update if dangerous things start to happen
   * Focus on opsec, for now.
