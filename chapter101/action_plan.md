[X] Action Plan: No Politics Please

[Link to Plan Post.](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7811645/)

Goals:
===
  * Survive.
  * Tell Inoue-sensei this isn't her fault.
  * Respond to the "Join Konoha" question.
  * Make a good present for Keiko.

Methods:
===

### **Scene Inoue-sensei**


* Steps:
  * Explain to her that it isn't her fault.
  * Analyze the "Join Konoha" question.
  * Make a reply. No to Fire or Leaf citizenship. But willing to consider other angle.
* Supporting Information:
  * We want to consider the political question from all angle.
  * State that the pro are pretty good.
  * Explain possible reasons why it might not be good.
    * Kagome will be anxious about returning to Konoha so soon.
    * Yagura will get mad
      * Mist will go to war with Leaf, which we do not want.
      * OOC: Given the war that may or may not come soon, this may be a non-issue.
    * We absolutely establish ourselves as an innovative, if not powerful, sealmaster.
      * Leaf will take our threats very seriously, if they weren't before. A Freudian slip kills us horribly.
    * Leaf may choose to take Skywalker seals and kill us to keep us from falling into enemy hands/betraying Konoha.
      * Staying in Konoha mitigates this somewhat.
      * The anti-us faction (who Jiraiya was pushing against) may try to assassinate us for this reason.
    * Leaf becomes absurdly more powerful because they gain (near-)undisputed aerial control.
      * Will making Leaf absurdly powerful help Hazou's dream?
    * Mori and Wakahisa clans will hate Keiko and Noburi.
      * Both of them really do care about their clans. Unlike us; we just care about mummy.
      * We have to run this with them anyway; if they don't accept we aren't doing it anyway.
* Possible Issues:
 * Inoue-sensei might get puzzled about the political analysis.
 * Inoue-sensei might decide to kill us depending on our answer.
   * Unlikely. Also, extremely silly.

### Scene Noburi

* Goal: We want to help Noburi finish his medical training safely.
* Steps:
    * Let Noburi know we are supportive of his ambitions as a medic-nin and that we want to help him on that path
    * Discuss potential issues, and how we might address them
    * Do NOT suggest Noburi should not go. Suggest that we should be extra cautious.
* Supporting Information:
* Potential Issues
    * Hashimoto might not want to teach Noburi
      * Ask Noburi what things Hashimoto might want (ryo, Macerators...) and offer to help with getting these things.
    * Hunter-nin might notice Noburi and/or his barrel.
      * Bring up Noburi disguising his barrel as a travel sack or appropriate covering.
      * Suggest Noburi obfuscate his movement through clever Henge use:
        * Noburi + Inoue go to Hashimoto's.
          * When Noburi leaves, Inoue creates a Water Clone Henge'd as Noburi.
          * Inoue & clone leave.
          * Repeat when Noburi leaves (at a set time?).


### Scene Gift for Keiko

Contingencies
===

* We should already be ready to relocate at any time. 
  * We should know where we are going to escape.
  * We should have enough seal blanks for escape + mission.
* Escape paths:
   * Have traps set up so we can escape to the southwest river or the eastern coast (depending on the situation).
   * More if Kagome-/Inoue-sensei say so.
* Jiraiya calls us in:
   * Figure out what country we're going to, then draft plans
   * Will probably involve water/coastal routes
   * Should be a good stopping point to end an update.
* Pangolin stuff:
   * Be polite and careful. Let Inoue-sensei or Keiko take the leads.
   * Get ready for a mission. See the Jiraiya section.
*  A wild ??? appears:
   * End update if dangerous things start to happen
   * Focus on opsec, for now.
